# minimos-reset

This is a lightweight, modern CSS reset similar to normalize.css but better. It is actually based on Canonical.css but with some modifications.

Features:

- sets the proper box model and other global settings
- provide default styles for all elements
- removes browser quirks and inconsistencies
- enables responsive images and videos
- enables responsive typography and "rem" scaling
- and more

Inspired by:
